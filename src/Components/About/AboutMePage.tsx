                I'm currently studying Data Science at UCSD. I'm pursuing a Math Minor because I
                love <Emphasize text="analytical" /> thinking and solving challenging problems. I'm
                also pursuing a Cognitive Science Minor because I'm passionate about creating
                beautiful products that <Emphasize text="wow" /> people.

                I've loved every aspect of engineering since I first joined robotics in middle
                school. Working hands-on excites me because of the
                <Emphasize text="limitless possibilities" /> within my palms. Here's a recent
                project of mine where I designed, assembled, and programmed a
                <Emphasize text="self-playing guitar" /> over a few weeks with some friends.

                During quarantine, I was incredibly bored and looking for new things to learn. I
                quickly came to love turning my <Emphasize text="ideas" /> into code. Long story
                short, it didn't take long before I became
                <Emphasize text="obsessed" /> with creating through code.

                You'll find me working on side projects or learning new programming skills. Other
                than that, I enjoy playing guitar, basketball, hitting the gym, and gaming with my
                friends.
